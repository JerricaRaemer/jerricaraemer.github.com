# Jerrica Raemer

### Results-Driven, Detail-Focused Data Analyst

## I'm Glad You're Here

> From math major to data translator — I’ve always loved finding meaning in the numbers.
>
> I aim to be a strategic thought partner, not just a data puller. I work to deeply understand the business problem, focus on what truly matters in the data, and deliver insights with clarity and purpose. Stakeholders can count on me to connect the dots, cut through the noise, and communicate findings without jargon or guesswork.
>
> Over the years, I’ve worked everywhere from customer service desks to benefit administration teams to data analysis projects. What’s stayed constant is my curiosity: how data can tell a story, solve a problem, or make someone’s day easier. That’s what drives my work.
