## About Me

> I’m a data analyst with a BS in mathematics and a background in benefits administration. I specialize in transforming complex, compliance-heavy data into clear, actionable insights. My work sits at the intersection of analytics, process improvement, and people.
>
> Before moving into analytics, I spent over six years in benefits administration, where I learned the importance of accuracy, privacy, and empathy in handling sensitive information. That experience taught me how much trust matters and to bring care and precision to every dataset I touch.
>
> Today, I combine technical tools (e.g. Excel, SQL, Python, Tableau) and statistical knowledge with strong communication skills to bridge the gap between raw data and real understanding.
>
> Outside of analytics, you can usually find me exploring Oregon’s coast, walking in the rain, or petting puppies. I am always eager to connect with others, embrace new experiences, and bring positivity and enthusiasm to everything I do.

## Approach to Benefits Administration

> **The heart behind my work**
> 
> I’m passionate about benefits because it is the intersection of humanity and livelihood. Benefits administration requires a balance of detailed, technical work and knowledge with empathy and compassion for the lived human experience. If I can help one person in my day navigate the complex world of benefits, I’m doing my job correctly. My goal for every participant is to help them fully utilize their benefits package in a way that best supports their specific living situation. This isn’t new territory for me; I understand what’s ahead and I’m prepared. I worked in pretax benefits administration for 6 years across two companies, each with their own interpretation of regulations and compliance. This experience taught me to be flexible, thorough, and curious.
