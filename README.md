## I'm Glad You're Here

> From math major to data translator — I’ve always loved finding meaning in the numbers.
>
> I aim to be a strategic thought partner, not just a data puller. I work to deeply understand the business problem, focus on what truly matters in the data, and deliver insights with clarity and purpose. Stakeholders can count on me to connect the dots, cut through the noise, and communicate findings without jargon or guesswork.
>
> Over the years, I’ve worked everywhere from customer service desks to benefit administration teams to data analysis projects. What’s stayed constant is my curiosity: how data can tell a story, solve a problem, or make someone’s day easier. That’s what drives my work.
> 

## About Me
> I’m a data analyst with a BS in mathematics and a background in benefits administration. I specialize in transforming complex, compliance-heavy data into clear, actionable insights. My work sits at the intersection of analytics, process improvement, and people.
>
> Before moving into analytics, I spent over six years in benefits administration, where I learned the importance of accuracy, privacy, and empathy in handling sensitive information. That experience taught me how much trust matters and to bring care and precision to every dataset I touch.
>
> Today, I combine technical tools (e.g. Excel, SQL, Python, Tableau) and statistical knowledge with strong communication skills to bridge the gap between raw data and real understanding.
>
> Outside of analytics, you can usually find me exploring Oregon’s coast, walking in the rain, or petting puppies. I am always eager to connect with others, embrace new experiences, and bring positivity and enthusiasm to everything I do.
